Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy

The purpose of this project is to make an investment strategy. This is a momentum strategy, therefore we will analyze which stocks have the greatest/most-positive momentum, and then invest in those stocks.

The strategy involves selecting up to 50 of the highest grossing stocks, and then making a recommended equal-weight investment portfolio.
